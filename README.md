## Motivation
Everyday day we unlock our phone 150-300 times a day. If this takes ~3 seconds than you waste 8-15 minutes of your life by just looking at unlock screen! Face unlock and fingerprint technologies make this process a little bit faster, but still, most people use cheap smartphones without those technologies, and you still have to unlock your phone each time you want to use it. If you had opportunity to lock only selected apps, this would make your life much easier and using phone would be just pleasant.

- The whole project is written on Python
- Main framework for Android developing - Kivy
- Main libraries for Face recognition - OpenCV and dlib

## Project status
Projects just started. Version: pre-alpha 0.1

## How to use?
### Currently we don't have working demo, but if you want to test examples:
1) **Install Python**<br/>
  Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3`<br/>
