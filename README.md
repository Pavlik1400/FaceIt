## Motivation
Everyday day we unlock our phone 150-300 times a day. If this takes ~3 seconds, then you waste 8-15 minutes of your life by just looking at the unlock screen! Face unlock, and fingerprint technologies make this process a little bit faster, but still, most people use cheap smartphones without those technologies, and you still have to unlock your phone each time you want to use it. If you had the opportunity to lock only selected apps, this would make your life much easier, and using the phone would be just pleasant.

## Repository content
- examples - folder with examples of using of different python libraries
- docs - contains various documents that explain the project more. Also, you can visit the wiki for more info

## Some technical points
- The whole project is written on Python
- The main framework for Android developing - Kivy
- Main libraries for Face recognition - OpenCV and dlib

## Project status
Projects just started. Version: pre-alpha 0.1

## How to use?
### Currently, we don't have a working demo, but if you want to test examples:
1) **Install Python**<br/>
  Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3`<br/>
  Arch-Linux: `sudo pacman -S python3`<br/>
  Windows: visit [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), choose the appropriate version, and install it.
2) **Install needed libraries. Examples should have their short README.md to tell what you need to download.**<br/>
  `pip3 install opencv-python`<br/>
  `pip3 install kivy` (Better to follow [official guide](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-linux.html), there are a lot of dependencies)<br/>
  `pip3 install face_recognition`

### Used libraries
List of all libraries used in all examples: \[opencv-python, kivy, matplotlib, tensorflow, mtcnn, face_recognition, dlib\]
