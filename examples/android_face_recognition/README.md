**This is alpha version of face recognition application**

Install .apk file on your android phone. Press "add user" to run face saving activity. Then press take picture and type your name. It is good idea to take many pictures, then accurasy will be better. When another photo, just choose available user. 
After this press "recognise" button in main menu. After that application should recognise you. 

We didn't share app code, because project is about 3 GB with all libraries.

We took all libraries and some methods from [this open-source project](https://github.com/Lauszus/FaceRecognitionApp/blob/master/README.md)
